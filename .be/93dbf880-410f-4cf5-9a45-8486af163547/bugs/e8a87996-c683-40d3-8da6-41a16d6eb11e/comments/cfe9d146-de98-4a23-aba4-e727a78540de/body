This is a substantial change, replacing jQuery, Bootstrap, and SweetAlert2 with
our own JS/CSS.  These tools feel like overkill for what we're using them for,
and they are probably not worth the extra requests it takes to load them in.
There are also likely efficiency gains from using vanilla JS instead of jQuery
for manipulating the DOM.
