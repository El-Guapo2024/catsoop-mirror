I've not been able to pinpoint the cause of this yet, but sometimes processes
are left running and eating a bunch of CPU rather than properly dying. This has
been an issue in 6.009, where it has caused problems with timeouts (because the
spinning processes slow everything down, code that should pass in time is
sometimes hitting the timeouts).

Will need to look into this more closely.
