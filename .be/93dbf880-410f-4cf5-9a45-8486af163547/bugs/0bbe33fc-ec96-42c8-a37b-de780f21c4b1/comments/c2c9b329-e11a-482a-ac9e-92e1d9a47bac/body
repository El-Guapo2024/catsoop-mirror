Right now, default values for question types (within a course) are kind of a
pain, in part because different question types use the same names, sometimes to
mean different things.  This makes setting course-specific defaults for `csq_`
options needlessly difficult, and it also leads to unfortunate naming issues
like `cs_multiplechoice_renderer`.

One approach would be a dictionary `cs_qtype_defaults` mapping question type
names to dictionaries containing defaults for that question type.  This would
probably want to be loaded into a question's environment after the page content
but before the contents of the `<question>` tag itself.
