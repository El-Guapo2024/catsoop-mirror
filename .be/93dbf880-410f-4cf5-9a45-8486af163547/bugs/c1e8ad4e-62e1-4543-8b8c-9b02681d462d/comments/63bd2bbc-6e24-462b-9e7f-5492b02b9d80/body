It might be nice to be able to distinguish between someone who is authenticated
but does not have access to the course in question, and someone who is not
authenticated at all.  This is particularly true at MIT, where courses using
OpenID Connect may wish to restrict access to MIT students (but not necessarily
just to those in the class).

We could implement a separate "Unauthenticated" role for users who are not
logged in, and use that to control access.
