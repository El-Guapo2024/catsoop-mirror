We should add an easy way to back up the salt used for encryption when it is
enabled.  I don't have a way to store it directly with the logs (and maybe
that's not a good idea anyway), so we need an easy way for people to back it
up.  The salt is necessary for decrypting the data, so it is really important
that it is backed up somewhere in the case where logs are encrypted.

Maybe we just print a hexlified version during setup_catsoop.py and tell people
to back it up somewhere.

Then we should also have an easy way to recover from a backed-up salt (maybe
setup_catsoop.py should ask if they want to specify a salt, versus having the
script generate one).
