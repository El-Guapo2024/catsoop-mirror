Recommending bubblewrap (https://github.com/projectatomic/bubblewrap) for
Python sandboxing (either instead of or in addition to the current AppArmor
approach) might be a good idea.  It seems to work very nicely and is a big
improvement over our current approach in terms of filesystem isolation, among
other things.

It might even be possible to automate its deployment, which would simplify the
process of setting up a CAT-SOOP instance.

An alternative would be to write our own little wrapper around Linux's user
namespaces.
