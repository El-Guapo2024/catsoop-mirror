With `cs_checker_parallel_checks` >= 1, there is a chance that the results
recorded to the `problemstate` log are not actually associated with the most
recent submission.  A check should be added to make sure that the result we
just computed is actually associated with the most recent submission before
writing to the `problemstate` log.    I think this is what happened on 6.009's
quiz 3 last term, where several students' submissions were left spinning.
Some work needs to be done here to reproduce the issue before we can really
track down a fix.
