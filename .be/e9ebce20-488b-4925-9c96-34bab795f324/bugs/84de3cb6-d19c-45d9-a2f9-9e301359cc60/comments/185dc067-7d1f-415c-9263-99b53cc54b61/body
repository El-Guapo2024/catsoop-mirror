Currently, a lot of the code for handling roles, sections, and custom weekly
times (e.g., homework releases on Tuesdays at 8am) lives not in CAT-SOOP
itself, but rather within courses. Many classes at MIT now have the same (or
similar) code in their preload files to handle these kinds of things.    It
might be time to integrate these into CAT-SOOP itself, rather than requiring
courses to include code for them.
