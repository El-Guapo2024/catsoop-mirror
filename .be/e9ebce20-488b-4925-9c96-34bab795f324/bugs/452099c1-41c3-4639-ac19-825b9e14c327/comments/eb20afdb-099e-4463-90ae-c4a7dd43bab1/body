Jason Ku brought this up in a brief conversation.  It is currently possible to
find out some information about the inputs used in "hidden" test cases in the
`pythoncode` question type, by printing that information to `stderr`.  While
`stdout` can currently be hidden, `stderr` cannot.  It shouldn't be hard to add
a toggle to disable showing `stderr`.
