I'm going to mark this resolved. Unfortunately, as far as I can tell,
`oidc.mit.edu` doesn't currently support logging out with a redirect back to
CAT-SOOP. I think until that is changed, we can't do this without making the
sacrifice of having the user logged out and redirected to the OIDC landing page,
rather than back to our site (which I think would be confusing).  If I'm wrong
and there is a way around that, feel free to reopen this.
