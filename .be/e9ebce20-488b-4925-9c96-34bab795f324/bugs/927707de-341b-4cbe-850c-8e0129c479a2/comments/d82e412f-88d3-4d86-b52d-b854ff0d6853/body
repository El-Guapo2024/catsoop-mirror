Since `config_loc` is written before the directory for `cs_data_root` is
created, creating `cs_data_root/courses` fails.  If `config_loc` is (intended
by the user) to be a directory rather than a file name, presumably CAT-SOOP
should just create the directory and then name the config file `config.py`?
