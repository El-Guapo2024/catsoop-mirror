Hmm.  I see what's happening.  I agree that a crash is bad, but I'm not sure I
know what makes sense as the right behavior here.  I'm not sure there is a way
for us to know that the user intends a directory, versus a file.    I guess in
your example it could be inferred from looking at the two given paths, but is
there something we can do to infer that in a general sense?  At the point when
we would want to do that check, no directories have been made yet, so I think
it's hard.    Do you have a sense of (or suggestion for) how we might handle
this in a general sense?
