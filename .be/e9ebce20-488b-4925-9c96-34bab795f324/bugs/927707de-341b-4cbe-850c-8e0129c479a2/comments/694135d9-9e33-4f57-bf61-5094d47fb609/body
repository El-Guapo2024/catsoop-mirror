Maybe something along the lines of

1. Create the cat-soop-data directory (`cs_data_root`).
2. Does `config_loc` already exists as a directory?
    Yes: Write the config to `config_loc/config.py`, after prompting for
         confirmation.
    No: Write the config to `config_loc` (current behavior)
