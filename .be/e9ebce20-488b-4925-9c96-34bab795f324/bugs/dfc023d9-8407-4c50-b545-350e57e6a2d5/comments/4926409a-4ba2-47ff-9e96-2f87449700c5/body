Right now, question types can define a behavior that is referred to as `check`.
It's used in a number of question types (running the code for `pythoncode`,
checking syntax for `expression`, etc).  But this idea isn't very general.  It
would be good to let question types have an arbitrary number of possible custom
actions.
