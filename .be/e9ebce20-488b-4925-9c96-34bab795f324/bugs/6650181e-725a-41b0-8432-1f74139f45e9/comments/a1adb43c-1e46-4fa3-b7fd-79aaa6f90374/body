Right now, each section's anchor's name takes the form `catsoop_section_X_Y_Z`,
which results in links to specific sections of a document looking like
`http://url_root/page#catsoop_section_X_Y_Z`.  It would be great if these
instead (or additionally) had names that went like the section titles.
Wikipedia does something like this, for example:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smash_Mouth#Band_members
