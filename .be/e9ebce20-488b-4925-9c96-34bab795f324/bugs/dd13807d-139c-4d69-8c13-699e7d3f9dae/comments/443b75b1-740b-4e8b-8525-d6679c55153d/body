The current manual grading interface is a hack that was done very quickly for
6.02 a long time ago.  A number of changes would be nice:

* Grading and impersonation should be separate permissions.
* Assigning graders to individual students
* Anonymizing students when displayed to graders
* Better interface for viewing student submissions (e.g., to `richtext`
  questions).

It's possible that some infrastructure could be taken from 6.01's exam grading
infrastructure.
