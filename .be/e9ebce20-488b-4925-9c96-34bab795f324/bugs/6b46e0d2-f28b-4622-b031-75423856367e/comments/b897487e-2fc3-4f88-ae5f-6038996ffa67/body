This whole function could use some refactoring, but the relevant portion of
code is near the bottom of `content_file_location` in `dispatch.py`.  I think
it should just be another check in the case we're loading from a file, to make
sure not only that the file in question exists, but also that it does not start
with `_` or `.`.
