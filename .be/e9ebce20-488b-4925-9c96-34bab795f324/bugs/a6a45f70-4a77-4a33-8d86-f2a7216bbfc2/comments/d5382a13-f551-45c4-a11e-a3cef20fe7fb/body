CAT-SOOP 1.0 had a question type where users were asked to enter an expression
whose answer was a _range_ of numbers.  For example, [0,3)U(4,7] was a
well-formed input representing a range from 0 (inclusive) to 3 (exclusive) and
from 4 (exclusive) and 7 (inclusive).    I've had a couple of requests to bring
this back.  CAT-SOOP has changed a lot since then, but I think it's possible
that it would be a relatively straightforward port of the code from 1.0.
