The intention was to make sure that, when on a screen that it itself bigger
than 900px, the `cs_content` div is always at least 900px wide.  It looks like
that is being applied everywhere (making it difficult to view CAT-SOOP pages on
mobile devices).    The appropriate place to look is
__STATIC__/themes/base.css.
