Currently, an empty line in the middle of a custom tag will often lead to that
tag being "cut off" before the first empty line, and the remaining content will
render outside the tag in question.    A workaround is to use HTML `<p></p>`
tags in place of line breaks inside of custom tags, but that is pretty ugly.
@kade is in the process of a rewrite of the `catsoop.language` module to handle
things more generally.
