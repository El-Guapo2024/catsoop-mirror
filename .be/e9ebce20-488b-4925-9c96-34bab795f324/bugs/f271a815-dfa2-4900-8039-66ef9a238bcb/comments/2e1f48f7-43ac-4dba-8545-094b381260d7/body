I think the right entry point for this change is the `main` function in
`dispatch.py`.  Right now, things short circuit in the case of requesting a
static file.  I think we want to keep that short-circuiting in place but only
do that in the case where the URL actually represents a static _file_ on disk.
Then, farther down the function (after we've run the `preload.py` files), if
the resource being requested represents a static _directory_, we can check to
see if some option (yet to be defined) has been set, and, if it has, generate a
page to list the files in the directory.    We'll need to make sure this
properly handles not only the base `__STATIC__` directory, but also
subdirectories.
