Currently, several courses have gradebooks that are really slow because they
need to loop over _all_ of a student's activity to determine their scores.
This is incredibly slow, and if enough students load their gradebook
simultaneously, it can effectively accidentally act as a DoS attack.  It would
be nice to add a way to allow courses to specify information that should be
cached for every problem (or for every user, or....).

Maybe this is a group of two functions:

* cs_update_user_page_cache(old_cache, submission), which updates a
  per-user-per-page cache (every user has a cache per page).

* cs_update_user_cache(old_cache, submission), which updates a per-user cache.

I'll need to think a bit more about the form these functions take (and whether
the above are the two types of caches that make sense).  But it's a really nice
idea that can prevent some progress/gradebook pages from being a really sticky
river late in the semester.
