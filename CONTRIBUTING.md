More contributors are always welcome!  Please see below for some guidelines, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you have questions.

#### Do you have a question about using CAT-SOOP?

We're happy to help!  There are a couple of options for asking questions:

* send an e-mail to `catsoop-users@mit.edu`, or
* drop by the IRC room (`#catsoop` on `irc.oftc.net`), or
* open an issue on the [issue tracker](https://hz.mit.edu/git/catsoop/catsoop/issues) (requires making an account).

#### Did you find a bug?

**If you have found a security vulnerability, please do not post publicly.**  In that case, please instead send e-mail directly to Adam (`hz@mit.edu`), optionally encrypting your message with [his public key](https://hz.mit.edu/hz_pubkey.asc).

For other issues, as a first step, please ensure that they were not already reported_ by looking through the [issue tracker](https://hz.mit.edu/git/cat-soop/cat-soop/issues/).

If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, feel free to report your issue in any of the following ways:

* send an e-mail to `catsoop-dev@mit.edu`, or
* drop by the IRC room (`#catsoop` on `irc.oftc.net`), or
* open an issue on the [issue tracker](https://hz.mit.edu/git/catsoop/catsoop/issues) (requires making an account).

Regardless of how you report the issue, please be as descriptive as you can, and please try to include an example that demonstrates the issue if possible.

If you have questions about the bug reporting process, or if are unsure whether you've found a bug, please don't hesitate to reach out via e-mail, IRC, or the issue tracker.

#### Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?

If you are familiar with the web interface for the [repository](https://hz.mit.edu/git/cat-soop/cat-soop), feel free make an account, fork the repository, and open a pull request there.

Otherwise, start by cloning the repository:

    git clone https://hz.mit.edu/git/catsoop/catsoop

Then suggest your change in the `catsoop-dev@mit.edu` mailing list, and feel free to start writing code!  But note that there is no need to submit a patch until you have collected positive feedback about the change.

#### Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?

If you are comfortable with the web interface to the [repository](https://hz.mit.edu/git/cat-soop/cat-soop), the best way to submit your patch is to create an account, fork the repository, and submit a pull request.

If you are not comfortable with the web interface, that doesn't mean that we won't accept a contribution!  Ideally, by this point, we will already have been discussing your issue on the mailing list and/or via the issue tracker.  In either case, please send us one of the following:

* a patch (or patches) generated via `git format-patch`, based on the current `master` branch, or
* a pointer to a location from which we can pull your changes.

If you've been working through the issue tracker, you may find it easier to open a pull request there.

If you're unsure of what that means, we can accept changes in other forms, as well; feel free to reach out on the `catsoop-dev@mit.edu` mailing list if you have questions, and we'll help get you set up.

#### Do you want to contribute to the documentation?

We really appreciate it!

If you are comfortable doing so, the best way to submit documentation patches is by submitting a pull request to the [web site repository](https://hz.mit.edu/git/catsoop/website).

But we'll accept documentation changes in any format!  Feel free just to e-mail your changes to `catsoop-dev@mit.edu`.
