<section>About CAT-SOOP</section>

CAT-SOOP is a flexible, programmable learning management system based on the
Python programming language.  During the 2018-2019 academic year, CAT-SOOP was
used in 12 subjects at MIT, and total enrollment in these subjects was around
3000 students.  While CAT-SOOP's core functionality is the collection and
assessment of online exercises, it has been extended to support a variety of
different features including, among others:

* content presentation (via text, video, interactive simulations, etc)
* grade reports and analytics (including fine-grained control over grading, due dates, extensions, and lateness penalties)
* queueing system for managing requests for help in an in-class lab environment or office hours
* real-time analytics for synchronous lab assignments
* timed quizzes
* a variety of subject-specific question types
* group exercises (with randomly-assigned or self-selected groups)
* finely-grained control over release/due dates (by section, or for individuals)
* an interface for online grading of paper exams

<subsection>History</subsection>

CAT-SOOP is a descendent of a system written by Tom&aacute;s
Lozano-P&eacute;rez in the early-to-mid 1990's, referred to around MIT as "the
tutor."  The tutor was widely used at MIT and other universities.  In 2011,
CAT-SOOP and another system (Ike Chuang's `tutor2`, which I understand
eventually grew into [Open edX](https://open.edx.org)) were both developed in
parallel as potential replacements for the tutor in MIT's 6.01 (Introduction to
Electrical Engineering and Computer Science via Robotics).  Despite having been
designed for 6.01, CAT-SOOP was actually first used in the fall 2011 offering
of 6.003 (Signals and Systems), while `tutor2` was used in 6.01.  CAT-SOOP was
first used in 6.01 in the spring 2013 semester, and it began to see use in other
subjects in later semesters.
