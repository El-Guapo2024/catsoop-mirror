The easiest and best way to contribute to CAT-SOOP is to use it, to report any
issues you find, and to tell your colleagues if you like it!

Please see below for some guidelines about contributing more directly to
CAT-SOOP, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you have questions.

### Do you have a question about using CAT-SOOP?

We're happy to help!  There are a couple of options for asking questions:

* send an e-mail to `~adqm/catsoop@lists.sr.ht`, or
* drop by the IRC room (`#catsoop` on `irc.oftc.net`), or
* open an issue on the [issue tracker](https://todo.sr.ht/~adqm/catsoop).

### Did you find a bug?

**If you have found a security vulnerability, please do not post publicly.** In
that case, please instead send e-mail to `~adqm/catsoop-security@lists.sr.ht`,
or send e-mail directly to Adam (`hz@mit.edu`), optionally encrypting your
message with [his public key](https://hz.mit.edu/hz_pubkey.asc).

For other issues, as a first step, please ensure that they were not already
reported by looking through the [issue
tracker](https://todo.sr.ht/~adqm/catsoop).  If you're unable to find an open
issue addressing the problem, feel free to report your issue in any of the ways
described above.

Regardless of how you report the issue, please be as descriptive as you can,
and please try to include an example that demonstrates the issue if possible.

If you have questions about the bug reporting process, or if are unsure whether
you've found a bug, please don't hesitate to reach out via e-mail, IRC, or the
issue tracker.

### Do you intend to add a new feature, change an existing behavior, or fix a bug?

A good place to start is to suggest your change in the
`~adqm/catsoop-dev@lists.sr.ht` mailing list or in the IRC room, and to read
through the [hacker's guide](CURRENT/hacking) for information on the process
for contributing code, as well as information about coding style, tests, etc.

#### Do you want to contribute to the documentation?

We really appreciate it!

If you are comfortable doing so, the best way to submit documentation changes
is by the same process described above, as described in the [hacker's
guide](CURRENT/hacking).
But we'll accept documentation changes in any format!  Feel free just to e-mail
your changes/suggestions (in any format) to `~adqm/catsoop-dev@lists.sr.ht`.
