WHAT IS IT?
-----------
CAT-SOOP is a tool for automatic collection and assessment of online
exercises, originally developed primarily for use in MIT's 6.01 (Introduction
to Electrical Engineering and Computer Science).  It has since been used in
multiple courses at MIT, and also at Olin College.

No animals were harmed in the making of this CAT-SOOP.


CAN I USE IT FOR MY COURSE?
---------------------------
Yes!  CAT-SOOP is free/libre software (see LICENSE file for details).  Please
note that the terms of this license apply only to the CAT-SOOP system itself
and not to any third-party software included with CAT-SOOP, nor to any course
material hosted on a CAT-SOOP instance, unless explicitly stated otherwise.

Documentation is currently somewhat lacking (read: totally nonexistent), but
we are working on it...


HOW DO I GET IT?
----------------
You can download the latest stable version from
    https://cat-soop.org/cat-soop-latest.zip

Development is carried out on Gitlab.com, so you can also clone the most
recent (potentially unstable) version with the following:
    $ git clone https://gitlab.com/adqm/cat-soop.git

If you have SSH keys on Gitlab.com, you can clone instead with:
    $ git clone git@gitlab.com:adqm/cat-soop.git


IS IT ANY GOOD?
---------------
Yes.
