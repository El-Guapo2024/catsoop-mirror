WHAT IS IT?

CAT-SOOP is a tool for automatic collection and assessment of online
exercises, originally developed primarily for use in MIT's 6.01 (Introduction
to Electrical Engineering and Computer Science via Robotics).

CAT-SOOP is free/libre software, available under the terms of the GNU Affero
General Public License, version 3+.  Please note that the terms of this
license apply to the CAT-SOOP system itself and any plugins in use, but not to
any course material hosted on a CAT-SOOP instance, unless explicitly stated
otherwise.
