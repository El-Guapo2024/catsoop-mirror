Planned Features:

  * Move pycs files into cs_data_root so they don't pollute the courses'
    directories.

  * Integrate the help queue

  * Implement relative due dates

  * Implement a better method for course-specific defaults for questions.
    Probably a cs_qtype_defaults dictionary mapping qtype names to dictionaries
    containing specific defaults.  This would clean things up a bit and help
    avoid unfortunate naming issues like cs_multiplechoice_renderer by
    namespacing all the defaults.

  * Allow pythoncode checkers to look at more than just the log entry (in
    particular, stdout).

  * Improve checker for expression QTYPE:
      * Allow checking of integrals
      * Allow checking of derivatives

  * Implement Numeric Range QTYPE
      (can probably adapt from CAT-SOOP 1.0)

  * Implement Drag-and-Drop QTYPE
      (based on edX)

  * Improve infrastructure for giving hints

  * Easy way to access order of questions on page

  * MP-style hints
      csq_hints = [{'name':..., 'hint':..., 'penalty':...,}]
      then in problemstate, keep hints_viewed

  * Post-submission hints based on response

Known Bugs:

  * Python error messages coming from code in <python> tags tend to show
    incorrect line numbers.

  * In ratio mode, checker for expression question type fails if solution
    evaluates to 0.

Things to Think About:

  * Consider removing .pycs files altogether (with the current structure, I
    doubt they save us much time; they may actually be slowing things down
    now...)

  * Consider implementing "legacy" checker
      For those who don't want to use the fancy new stuff, and nice to have for
      things like surveys.

  * Make CAT-SOOP builtins work without jQuery (but still include jQuery in
    case courses want to use it).

  * Implement Piazza replacement
