Planned Features/Changes:

  * Access control for static files (in __MEDIA__).

  * Integrate roles, sections into everything (rather than having them live in
    6.01).

  * Bring back tutorlib (library of common checker functions).

  * Integrate Jacob's updated circuit simulator.

  * Implement relative due dates

  * Implement a better method for course-specific defaults for questions.
    Probably a cs_qtype_defaults dictionary mapping qtype names to dictionaries
    containing specific defaults.  This would clean things up a bit and help
    avoid unfortunate naming issues like cs_multiplechoice_renderer by
    namespacing all the defaults.

  * Allow pythoncode checkers to look at more than just the log entry (in
    particular, stdout).

  * Improve checker for expression QTYPE:
      * Allow checking of integrals
      * Allow checking of derivatives

  * Implement Numeric Range QTYPE
      (can probably adapt from CAT-SOOP 1.0)

  * Implement Drag-and-Drop QTYPE
      (based on edX)

  * Improve infrastructure for giving hints

  * Easy way to access order of questions on page (rather than going through
    the context's cs_defaulthandler_name_map variable)

  * MP-style hints
      csq_hints = [{'name':..., 'hint':..., 'penalty':...,}]
      then in problemstate, keep hints_viewed

  * Post-submission hints based on response

  * Improved interface for circuit simulator question type

  * Make CAT-SOOP work without Javascript enabled (offer a way to
    submit/view/etc without javascript).

Known Bugs:

  * In ratio mode, checker for expression question type fails if solution
    evaluates to 0.

Things to Think About:

  * Make CAT-SOOP builtins work without jQuery (but still include jQuery in
    case courses want to use it).

  * Implement Piazza replacement (is this part of CAT-SOOP, or separate?)

  * Integrate 6.01's exam grading more tightly with CAT-SOOP?
