TODOs:

* write the queue stuff for the fs backend

* is this too ugly as-is?  passing around the connection is a pain

* load testing?

* postgres logs: queue_update should return the updated entry or None

* both: sort queue by _either_ created or updated timestamps?

* unit and integration tests for queue and logs (both fs and psql)
