    "body": "I'm thinking the right idea is actually to have things always stored in the binary format, but to provide a way to manually edit.  This might be a script like `catsoop logedit USERNAME PATH LOGNAME`, which translates the given file to its human-readable form, opens `$EDITOR` on that, and then converts the result back into the binary format after editing.  That would be a relatively easy way to get the best of both worlds (the logs can be fast/small, but we can still have an easy way to view/edit them).  Maybe a `catsoop logcat` as well, for viewing (but not editing) logs.\n",
