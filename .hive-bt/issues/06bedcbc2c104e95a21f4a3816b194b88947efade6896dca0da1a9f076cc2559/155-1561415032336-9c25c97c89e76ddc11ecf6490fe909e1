These could be categorized so that, maybe,\n`_catsoop.authentication`, `_catsoop.server`, `_catsoop.whatever` contain\nconfiguration variables for various logically-separate components.\n\nThis will be a disruptive change, so it will be really important to have an\nautomated way of converting to this new format, as well as documentation of all\nof the variables and all of the associated categories.",
