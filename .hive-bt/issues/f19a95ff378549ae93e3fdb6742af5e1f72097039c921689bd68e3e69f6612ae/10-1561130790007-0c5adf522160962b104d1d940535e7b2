For example, <code>[0,3)U(4,7]</code> was a well-formed input representing a range from 0 (inclusive) to 3 (exclusive) and from 4 (exclusive) and 7 (inclusive).\r\n\r\nI've had a couple of requests to bring this back.  CAT-SOOP has changed a lot since then, but I think it's possible that it would be a relatively straightforward port of the code from 1.0.\n",
