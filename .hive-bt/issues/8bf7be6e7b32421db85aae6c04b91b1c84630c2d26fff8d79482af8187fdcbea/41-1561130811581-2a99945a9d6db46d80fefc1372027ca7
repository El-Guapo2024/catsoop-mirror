I think we want to keep that short-circuiting in place but only do that in the case where the URL actually represents a static _file_ on disk.\r\n\r\nThen, farther down the function (after we've run the `preload.py` files), if the resource being requested represents a static _directory_, we can check to see if some option (yet to be defined) has been set, and, if it has, generate a page to list the files in the directory.\r\n\r\nWe'll need to make sure this properly handles not only the base `__STATIC__` directory, but also subdirectories.\n",
