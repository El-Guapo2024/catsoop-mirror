I'm not sure there is a way for us to know that the user intends a directory, versus a file.\r\n\r\nI guess in your example it could be inferred from looking at the two given paths, but is there something we can do to infer that in a general sense?  At the point when we would want to do that check, no directories have been made yet, so I think it's hard.\r\n\r\nDo you have a sense of (or suggestion for) how we might handle this in a general sense?\n",
