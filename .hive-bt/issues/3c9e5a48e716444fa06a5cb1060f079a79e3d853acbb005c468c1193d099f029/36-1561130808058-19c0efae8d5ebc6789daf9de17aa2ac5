This is incredibly slow, and if enough students load their gradebook simultaneously, it can effectively accidentally act as a DoS attack.  It would be nice to add a way to allow courses to specify information that should be cached for every problem (or for every user, or....).\r\n\r\nMaybe this is a group of two functions:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><code>cs_update_user_page_cache(old_cache, submission)</code>, which updates a per-user-per-page cache (every user has a cache per page).</li>\r\n<li><code>cs_update_user_cache(old_cache, submission)</code>, which updates a per-user cache.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nI'll need to think a bit more about the form these functions take (and whether the above are the two types of caches that make sense).  But it's a really nice idea that can prevent some progress/gradebook pages from being a really sticky river late in the semester.\n",
